### About me

I am Ahsan, a Full-stack developer with six years of experience developing business applications, specializing in front-end, back-end, and mobile application development.

Programming is my passion, with a keen interest in developing applications on the back-end in multiple technologies and having the majority of expertise in front-end development using Typescript.

- 🔭 I am working as a Senior Software Engineer at DigitalHire, where I am working at a futuristic Job board that lets people get hired using a video interview process that can save a lot of time on the hiring process.
